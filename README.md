=======
This is a basic program to capture data from Masimo Brand Pulse Oximeter and store the data in an influx database.

# Masimo Rad-8
See https://www.masimo.com/products/continuous/rad8/

The Masimo Rad-8 needs to be set in ASCII mode 1. By default the device is set to ASCII mode 2 for the serial output. Hold down the Enter Button and the Down Button for 5 seconds to change the parameter. See [manual](https://github.com/remkolems/masimo-datacapture/blob/master/Masimo%20Rad-8/Masimo%20Rad-8%20Operator's%20Manual.pdf) page 4-14 (section 4 Setup menu level 3).

B. The Alarm Status Indicator flashes when an alarm condition is present.\
C. Perfusion Index (Pi) indicates arterial pulse signal strength. The Pi display is green when perfusion index is greater than or equal to 0.5 while the Pi display is red when perfusion index is less than 0.5.
